Lucy is a hepatic, human cell - that is, she's inhabiting J***'s liver.
Her job is to clean up J***'s blood and make sure nothing bad stays in it for too long.
And she's very good at it, J***'s reached his 20th birthday in the best shape, thanks to her !
And he would live a lot longer, if only he continued on that track...
But last night, J*** broke up with his girlfriend.
And now he's on his way to Las Vegas.

Could you help Lucy do her job ? It looks like she's about to have quite a lot of work in the next few hours...
I heard J*** just broke up with his longterm girlfriend, so he might be struggling a bit...

It seems like J*** just got off the plane and is heading for the bar. He orders a bloody mary. That's Lucy's first job ! 
Try to help her as best as you can !
Alcohol is a very small hydrophilic molecule that can pass through the cell's lipid bilayer. It's metabolites are highly reactive molecules that can damage proteins, lipids and even DNA !
Try to produce more enzymes to eliminate alcohol and the products of its metabolism as fast as possible !

Well, if you're a kid you shouldn't have sex in the first place I guess. But hey, I'm not your mum. Did I tell you about HIV? What about it you ask? Didn't you go to high school? They don't teach you anything anymore these days."
