This is Lucy.

Lucy is a hepatic, human cell - that is, she's inhabiting J***'s liver.

Her job is to clean up J***'s blood and make sure nothing bad stays in it for too long.

And she's very good at it, J***'s reached his 20th birthday in the best shape, thanks to her !

And he would live a lot longer, if only he continued on that track...

But last night, J*** broke up with his girlfriend.
And now...

He's on his way to Las Vegas.
...


Could you help Lucy do her job ? It looks like she's about to have quite a lot of work in the next few hours...
~
#
It seems like J*** just got off the plane and is heading for the bar. He orders a bloody mary. That's Lucy's first job ! 
Try to help her as best as you can !

You can [i][color=red] click to influence the enzymes' path [/color][/i] and hopefully bring em closer to their metabolites.

Alcohol is a very small hydrophilic molecule that can pass through the cell's lipid bilayer. It's metabolites are highly reactive molecules that can damage proteins, lipids and even DNA !

Try to produce more enzymes to eliminate alcohol and the products of its metabolism as fast as possible !

[i][color=red]< Type A to produce more metabolic enzymes >[/color][/i]

#~
Oh, it seems like J*** is done with drinking for now, he's heading outside to get a taxi.
Okay, let's use this opportunity to recover a bit from alcohol's damage.

Working so hard leads to a high levels of cellular stress, as the more molecules and organelles wander around freely, the more oxydation damage you accumulate.
Also, don't forget to heal damage organelles otherwise your enzyme production might come down !
[color=red][i]
< Type W to produce more healing enzymes >
< Type S to regenerate damaged DNA >
[/i][/color]
As you see, you have limited amounts of energy. As you produce more metabolic enzymes, you have to give up on cell wall regeneration and DNA repair.

Talking about energy, it seems like J*** isn't heading for the hotel right now, he stopped at a Burger King, oh wow...
He just ordered a triple whooper and double portion of fries ! And a banana milkshake on tope of it ?! Are you sure J*** ?
Oh well... 
#
You should know that triglycerides conglomerate in lipid droplets that also take up cholesterol... and accumulation of cholesterol is harmful to .... whatever, we don't have don't enough time, here it comes !  Are you ready ? Produce more metabolic enzymes !

Thankfully, lipoproteins do not easily cross the cellular membrane. However, they will eventually and you have to be ready to get rid of them !

That's a lot of fat, come on J***.
You're young indeed and do lots of sports, but that's no reason to go on binge like this one !
There's only so much we can take !
~
#
You might have realized that degrading toxic components leave molecular components behind, these accumulate and can damage organelles by oxidation. You should produce lysosomes that could help clean the cellular lumen.
[color=red][i]
< Type D to produce lysosomes >
[/i][/color]
Okay, it seems like he got in a taxi again and reaches his hotel. He got his keys at the reception and... you're not going to your room ?
J*** ?
#
Where are you... oh, the bar...
okay, having a bit of trouble digesting eh ?
A double gin and tonic alright, here it comes...
and a whiskey ?

Maybe I should warn you, Lucy cannot take damage forever.
[i][color=red]Passed a certain threshold, she will go into apoptosis [/color][/i] - which is cell death.
You cannot let her reach that point ! Come on, let's get rid of all that alcohol !

#
Okay it seems like J*** headed for his room... he's laying on his bed right now, maybe he'll pass out... ?
It doesn't matter, we have to keep on recovering... Rebuild that cell wall !
~~~
Oh... I have bad news... J*** just woke up got his wallet and went out... 
I mean, we're in Las Vegas right ? Of course we wouldn't go to bed at 10...
He's hitting the casino and having a few drinks there, okay nothing we can't handle...
#
~
A young girl approach him, that's good maybe it'll lift him up a bit...
wait, what did she give him ?
It looks like a bag of white powder...
Oh...
You're not gonna take this, are you ?
J*** ?
#~
You should know that cocaine passes through cell walls by passive diffusion, as it is rapidly converted into an apolar form...
Also, I really hope you got rid of all that alcohol ?

Because of the presence of carboxylesterases in the liver, cocaine might be converted into another molecule if alcohol is present at the same time... and this molecule is highly hepatotoxic...
behold... Cocaethylene !

~~
I'm sorry, I'm so high I'm having troubles keeping up with what's going on.
I think J***'s still at the bar with the young lady...
they kissed... and then they... yeah. Okay...
~
They're going home...
#
...
J*** I beg you, stay safe... use a condom...

I SAID PLEASE PUT ON A CON - 
too late...
...
here comes HIV.
#
Be very careful, viruses are experts at disguising themselves and passing through all lipid bilayers.
Also, they usually try to inject themselves into the nucleus so you should probably - 
oh whatever... just try to keep Lucy alive.
~~~
Good job ! I believe we're good for today unless J*** tries anything stupid again.
#
What is he doing ?
Oh, I guess he has a headache so he took some painkillers before going to sleep.
If only he knew that this is all job for Lucy again...
Come on, you can do it !

This is Lucy.

Lucy is a hepatic, human cell - that is, she's inhabiting J***'s liver.

Her job is to clean up J***'s blood and make sure nothing bad stays in it for too long.

And she's very good at it, J***'s reached his 20th birthday in the best shape, thanks to her !

And he would live a lot longer, if only he continued on that track...

But last night, J*** broke up with his girlfriend.
And now...

He's on his way to Las Vegas.
...


Could you help Lucy do her job ? It looks like she's about to have quite a lot of work in the next few hours...
~
#
It seems like J*** just got off the plane and is heading for the bar. He orders a bloody mary. That's Lucy's first job ! 
Try to help her as best as you can !

You can  click to influence the enzymes' path  and hopefully bring em closer to their metabolites.

Alcohol is a very small hydrophilic molecule that can pass through the cell's lipid bilayer. It's metabolites are highly reactive molecules that can damage proteins, lipids and even DNA !

Try to produce more enzymes to eliminate alcohol and the products of its metabolism as fast as possible !

< Type A to produce more metabolic enzymes >

#~
Oh, it seems like J*** is done with drinking for now, he's heading outside to get a taxi.
Okay, let's use this opportunity to recover a bit from alcohol's damage.

Working so hard leads to a high levels of cellular stress, as the more molecules and organelles wander around freely, the more oxydation damage you accumulate.
Also, don't forget to heal damage organelles otherwise your enzyme production might come down !

< Type W to produce more healing enzymes >
< Type S to regenerate damaged DNA >

As you see, you have limited amounts of energy. As you produce more metabolic enzymes, you have to give up on cell wall regeneration and DNA repair.

Talking about energy, it seems like J*** isn't heading for the hotel right now, he stopped at a Burger King, oh wow...
He just ordered a triple whooper and double portion of fries ! And a banana milkshake on tope of it ?! Are you sure J*** ?
Oh well... 
#
You should know that triglycerides conglomerate in lipid droplets that also take up cholesterol... and accumulation of cholesterol is harmful to .... whatever, we don't have don't enough time, here it comes !  Are you ready ? Produce more metabolic enzymes !

Thankfully, lipoproteins do not easily cross the cellular membrane. However, they will eventually and you have to be ready to get rid of them !

That's a lot of fat, come on J***.
You're young indeed and do lots of sports, but that's no reason to go on binge like this one !
There's only so much we can take !
~
#
You might have realized that degrading toxic components leave molecular components behind, these accumulate and can damage organelles by oxidation. You should produce lysosomes that could help clean the cellular lumen.

< Type D to produce lysosomes >

Okay, it seems like he got in a taxi again and reaches his hotel. He got his keys at the reception and... you're not going to your room ?
J*** ?
#
Where are you... oh, the bar...
okay, having a bit of trouble digesting eh ?
A double gin and tonic alright, here it comes...
and a whiskey ?

Maybe I should warn you, Lucy cannot take damage forever.
Passed a certain threshold, she will go into apoptosis  - which is cell death.
You cannot let her reach that point ! Come on, let's get rid of all that alcohol !
